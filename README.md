# Pattern-Recognition

This Python script interfaces with a Myoband to collect EMG signals as the user makes different hand gestures. It extracts features from the EMG signal in real-time to predict which gesture the user is making. This has a direct application in myoelectric prosthetics allowing users to control a prosthesis more naturally using myoelectric signals in their residual limbs.
